1. Clone project Leonardo from github to a local folder.

	https://desktop.github.com/
	Install the Git client and create and account on github.

	https://github.com/nox282/Leonardo
	Click "Clone in Desktop" in bottom right to get a local copy in the client.
	You can also clone from the client if your account is member of the project.
	Or use this URL: https://github.com/noxcorporation/Leonardo.git
	
	Or you can also use the "Download ZIP" button
	This will not keep files up to date or let you participate to the project directly.
	
	Keep the project files in a location of your choice.

2. Install dependencies (GCC 4.9.2, SDL2)

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/Previous/1.1309.0/tdm64-gcc-4.9.2-3.exe/download
	Get and install TDM64 with GCC 4.9.2:
	Uncheck "Check for updated files on the TDM-GCC server".
	Leave the rest to default, you can choose your install directory.

	https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.3-mingw.tar.gz
	Get and unzip SDL2.
	Go to the SDL2-2.0.3\include directory and move all files to a new SDL2 folder.
	It should look like "SDL2-2.0.3\include\SDL2" and all .h files would be there.

3. Create a project in your favorite IDE and add all code files.

 -> Optional: If Beginner or no IDE:
	## BEGINNER:
	## http://downloads.codelite.org/downloads.php?windows_64
	## Install CodeLite.

	## Create a new Workspace for C++ named Leonardo.
	## Select the project source folder (with github files) and uncheck "Create a new folder".
	## Create a new project inside same folder with template "Others" -> "Non-code".
	## Name Leonardo and uncheck "Create a new folder".
	## Leave compiler and debugger to default for now. Validate.

	## Right click the project and "Import files from directory". Check all folders. Validate.

4. Setup IDE to use GCC 4.9.2 and link properly to SDL headers and lib files.

 -> Optional:
	## In CodeLite go to "Settings" -> "Build settings" -> "Add compilers" -> "Add an existing compiler"
	## Select the TDM-GCC-64 main directory. Name it "TDM-GCC-64 (GCC 4.9.2)".
	## Go to project right click "Settings".
	## In "General" change compiler to you newly created one.
	
	## In "Compiler", field "Include Paths" add the path to SDL2-2.0.3\include.
	## Don't include the SDL2 folder in the path.
	## In "Linker", field "Libraries Search Path" add the path to SDL2-2.0.3\lib\x64.
	## In field "Libraries" put "SDL2main;SDL2".

5. Compile the code. Verify that it compiles properly.

6. Add the runtimes to run the built executable.

	https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3-win32-x64.zip
	Unzip and drop the SDL runtime DLL next to the executable.
	Or a directory included in the PATH variable (not recommended).

 -> Optional:
	## For CodeLite put it in the Debug sub-folder of the project directory. Next to Leonardo.exe.
	## To run the executable you can use the Ctrl-F9 shortcut (re-compiles and runs).

7. You're all set to start contributing.
	Note: Your github account needs to be authorized to push new code to the master server.

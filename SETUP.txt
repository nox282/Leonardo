1. Clone project Leonardo from github to a local folder.

	https://desktop.github.com/
	Install the Git client and create and account on github.

	https://github.com/nox282/Leonardo
	Click "Clone in Desktop" in bottom right.
	Keep the project files in a location of your choice.

2. Install dependencies (GCC 5.2.0, SDL2)

	http://www.drangon.org/mirror.wsgi?num=3&fname=mingw-w64-bin-x86_64-20150801.7z
	Get and unzip mingw64 with GCC 5.2.0.
	Install in a location of your choice, avoid spaces in file path.
	Add the mingw64\bin full path to the Windows PATH environment variable.

	https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.3-mingw.tar.gz
	Get and unzip SDL2 for mingw64.
	Go to the mingw64\include directory and move all files starting with "SDL" to a new SDL2 folder.
	Consolidate this mingw64 with previous mingw64 folder.

3. Create a project in your favorite IDE and add all code files.

 -> Optional: If Beginner or no IDE:
	## BEGINNER:
	## http://downloads.codelite.org/downloads.php?windows_64
	## Install CodeLite.

	## Create a new Workspace for C++ named Leonardo.
	## Select the project source folder (with github files) and uncheck "Create a new folder".
	## Create a new project inside same folder with template "Others" -> "Non-code".
	## Name Leonardo and uncheck "Create a new folder".
	## Leave compiler and debugger to default for now. Validate

	## Right click the project and "Import files from directory". Check all folders. Validate.

4. Setup IDE to use GCC 5.2.0 and link properly to SDL headers and lib files.

 -> Optional:
	## In CodeLite go to "Settings" -> "Build settings" -> "Add compilers" -> "Add an existing compiler"
	## Select the mingw64 main directory. Validate.
	## Go to project right click "Settings".
	## In "General" change compiler to MinGW GCC 5.2.0.
	
	## In "Compiler", field "Include Paths" add the path to mingw64\include.
	## In "Linker", field "Libraries Search Path" add the path to mingw64\lib\x64.
	## In field "Libraries" put "SDL2main;SDL2".

5. Compile the code. Verify that it compiles properly.

6. Add the runtimes to run the built executable.

	https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3-win32-x64.zip
	Unzip and drop the SDL runtime DLL in the same folder as the executable.
	Or a directory included in the PATH variable (not recommended).

 -> Optional:
	## For CodeLite put it in the Debug sub-folder of the project directory. Next to Leonardo.exe.

7. You're all set to start contributing.
	Note: Your github account needs to be authorized to push new code to the master server.
